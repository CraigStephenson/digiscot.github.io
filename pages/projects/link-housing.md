## Project plan

### Project description

13 week City & Guilds Training with attainment of qualification and laptop.



## Project Milestones

### Phase 1
 
Recruitment of 40 tenants to the course.

### Phase 2

40 laptops supplied with Microsoft Windows and Office software activated.

### Phase 3

40 tenants start course (20 North Lanarkshire & 20 West Lothian).

### Phase 4

All attendees take City & Guilds exam.



## Evaluation

The main lesson learned in the implementation of the City & Guilds course was the extremely successful engagement tenants and the ease with which tenants were recruited to the course.  In fact, this course was so successful that there was a considerable reserve list created of over 50 tenants (in addition to the 40 tenants already recruited).
The course is of substantial length – 13 weeks – which makes a significant commitment by those attending essential.  The fact that there was noteworthy gains to be made in completing the course made this attractive to tenants in the first instance and also to keep that commitment once started.
As well as learning new skills and improving life chances throughout the duration of the course, those completing the course were given the opportunity to sit the City & Guilds exam and also take possession of the laptop on which they trained.
This course and the model on which it is based has been repeated with further internal funding from Link.


### Outputs and outcomes

All of those completing the course have taken possession of a refurbished Lenovo laptop, complete with laptop case and mouse.  This addresses one of the major barriers to getting online or developing digital skills; access to hardware.
Another barrier, which has been identified both by UK and Scottish Governments, is lack of digital skills.  This was the initial impetus to introduce this training opportunity.  All of those who attended attained and developed their skills in the use of a computer and accessing and safely using the internet.
The attainment of a City & Guilds qualification improves employability opportunities and gives a meaningful end-point to the course. 
60% of those attending have successfully taken the City & Guilds ICT Basic Online (level 3) exam.  This qualification can now be added to the CVs which were created for those seeking work and the skills attained will benefit all of those completing the course.
Of those attending, one tenant has already found employment as a direct impact of being on the course.  Another, who is a full-time carer, has used the skills obtained and the ownership of the laptop to improve the lives of herself and the person she cares for.  She has saved money by using online services and improved her knowledge and improved her situation by using various organisations’ websites.
A general sense of improved confidence and ability to use computers in other situations was clearly evident across the group, with many signing up for further online courses.


### Lessons learned

Things that worked well:

1.	Exam as an end-point
2.	Possession of a laptop as an engagement tool

Things that we would do differently next time:

1.	Length of course may have been too long
2.	More focus on employment
